## Interest Rate Modeling Using Recurrent Neural Networks

### Question/Need
Can Long Short-Term Memory networks be used to forecast U.S. interest rates? 

### Data Description
I plan to use 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12-month U.S. daily Treasury yield curve rates for the time period of January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2021, in order to forecast rates up to 3 months into the future. I intend to only use the daily Treasury rates to start, and add economic indicators for the same time frame like expected or actual inflation rates or consumer sentiment reports.

### Tools
NumPy and pandas, for data manipulation

Keras, for network creation and training



### MVP Goal
A baseline neural network model.
