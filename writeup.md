## Developing a Neural Network to Forecast U.S. Treasury Interest Rates



### Design
Per a Fed


### Data
I collected the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates , accessible through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website ([link](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield)), with data going back to January 1, 2000. I also collected the Daily Treasury Real Yield Curve Rates ([link](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield)) with data going back to January 2, 2003. For both sets of data longer time frames were tested (with max size of 59,191 data points) but a time frame of January 1, 2015 to July 2, 2021 (17,908 data points) was ultimately used to only collect signals from relatively recent interest rate adjustments.
