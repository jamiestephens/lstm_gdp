## Minimum Viable Product

I built a baseline univariate LSTM model that evaluated, from 01/01/2010 to 07/02/2021, the 10-year Treasury rate. This was done using Keras, TimeSeriesGenerator, 

The preprocessing for the data, which was sourced from the U.S. Treasury website, was done within preprocessing.py. The baseline model was completed within univariate_lstm_tsg.py.
  

For further evaluation, given the changing relationships in bond rates shown below, a multivariate approach will be taken
