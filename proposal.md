## Interest Rate Modeling Using Recurrent Neural Networks

### Question/Need
Can Long Short-Term Memory networks be used to forecast U.S. interest rates?


### Data Description
I plan to use 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12-month U.S. daily Treasury yield curve rates for the time period of January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2021.  


### Tools
NumPy and Pandas, for data manipulation
Keras, for network creation and training



### MVP Goal
A baseline neural network model
